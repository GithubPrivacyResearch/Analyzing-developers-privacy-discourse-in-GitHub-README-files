# Analyzing-developers-privacy-discourse-in-GitHub-README-files
 Abstract:

We adopt a socio-material perspective to examine how developers translate privacy, as a social value, into user applications. Our comprehensive survey of the research on developers’ privacy points to their key position as privacy mediators, and to their forums as a productive setting for an unobtrusive study of their discourse. The open-source code-sharing platform GitHub contains both discourse and code; focusing on GitHub, we analyzed nearly 60,000 README files created in 2008-2020 that include the term “privacy” and studied quantitatively and qualitatively how discourse is translated to code. Using VOSviewer we identified two main word clusters, “security” and “privacy policy.” Using Voyant-tools.org confirmed these findings, suggesting that some references elaborate on practices that safeguard privacy, while others discuss policy as a means for complying with both public and, ironically, commercial regulations. A closer reading of the files reveals that even privacy enthusiasts may inadvertently promote code that poses threats to privacy.

In this repository you can find the files that are utilized by VOSViewer to create the map illustrated in the article:
-	total uni pjk.net – stores the network data, including information about items and the links between them
-	total uni pjk2.clu – containing clustering information, specifying which items belong to which cluster
-	total uni pjk3.vec – stores vector data including items’ coordination that helps VOSVIewer accurately position items on the map

-	total uni gml.gml – a plain text format for describing graphs
-	total uni.txt – VOSViewer’s map in plain text format
-	total uni.png – a png format of the map
